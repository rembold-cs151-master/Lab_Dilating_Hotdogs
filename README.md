# Lab 3: Dilating Hotdogs

Today's lab is all about getting practice in defining variables and defining a simple function. Follow along with the Lab manual to add your code to the `Lab03.py` file.

The file `test_Lab03.py` has the testing functions which your function will be tested with. You don't have to edit anything in this file, but you are welcome to look at it if you want.
